This project was made the class CEC 205 VA: Agile Launchpad. This class was sponsored by Suncorp. All rights to the code and the project that was made, in its entirety, is reserved. This project was developed by the “Streak for the Gym” team who focused on producing a user friendly way to receive gym memberships and rewards based on their step streaks on Fitbit. The website will allow a user to login using their Fitbit credentials. This will redirect them to our site, which will show their streaks and points due to these streaks.
NOTE: one major bug that was not resolved due to the short duration of this project is the fact that the page MUST be refreshed after being redirected to receive the most recent information of the current user logged in.
The website starts streak calculations beginning one month prior to the first time a user logs in and will continue calculating these streaks every time that user logs in. In the future, it would be logical to adjust this code to start calculating streaks at the time a user first logs in, but for testing and to have more data to work with, a user can log in for the first time and see their calculations for the past one month. These points and streaks will carry on as live calculations as the user keeps logging on to our webpage.
NOTE: There has been instances where the personal information would not show up on the webpage until the site is refreshed twice, instead of once. The reason behind this error is unknown and only happens with certain accounts.
Current day steps are not calculated into the current streak until the day is completed. This means if the user is on a new streak, day one of seven, their current streak will be zero steps until the day is over then the amount will be evaluated.
Streaks are based on getting at least 7,000 steps per day for 7 days in a row.
Points are given based on where the total streak step count falls in predefined step ranges.
All rewards are non-functional, fictional prizes.
